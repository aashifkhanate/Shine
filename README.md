## Getting Started with Shine-YMCA

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:
- **Android Studio** — 2.3.x or newer.
- **Google Firebase Account**

### Installing

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/Shine-YMCA.git`
3. Move to the project folder with ```cd Shine-YMCA```
4. Pull any changes from your remote branch 'master': ```git pull origin master```
5. Make official Shine-YMCA repo known as upstream: ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/Manan-YMCA/Shine-YMCA.git```
6. Make sure to get the latest changes from official android/master branch: ```git pull upstream master```
7. Open Android Studio and select 'Import Project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc)'. Browse through your file system to the folder 'Shine-YMCA' where the project is located. Android Studio will then create the '.iml' files it needs. If you ever close the project but the files are still there, you just select 'Open Project…'. The file chooser will show an Android face as the folder icon, which you can select to reopen the project.
8. Android Studio will try to build the project directly after importing it. To build it manually, follow the menu path 'Build'/'Make Project', or just click the 'Play' button in the toolbar to build and run it in a mobile device or an emulator. The resulting APK file will be saved in the 'build/outputs/apk/' subdirectory in the project folder.

If you have any problem, remove the 'Shine-YMCA' folder, start again from 2) and work your way down. If something still does not work as described here, please open a new issue describing exactly what you did, what happened, and what should have happened.
